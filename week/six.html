      I found the Wired article, “Inside Cuba’s DIY Internet Revolution”, super exciting. The hackiness of the technology Cubans have created to workaround their government is reminiscent of early web culture. I really liked the part of the article describing the pilars that feed SNET and all the sort of one-off recreations of applications we find ourselves so dependent on. It’s almost comforting to know that social habits, like posting and commenting in forums and sharing photos, are being reborn in the same way, without being depended on American culture. The rhetoric from beginning through the middle of the article seemed very opptomistic and rewarding of the small group of technologists working around the government and hacking their “resolver”, however towards the end of the article, I found it disappointing that the author, Garcia chose to close the article on a negative note, saying that the hard work of these technologists wouldn’t save or change Cuba, which I believe is not something he is able to or should want to predict.
