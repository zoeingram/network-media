      <h3><em>Response to</em><br>"How Black Women Disrupt Surveillance Theory"<br> <em>by Sydette Harry</em></h3>

      <p>
        I found this essay particularly frustrating -- on behalf of the author, and black women existing in our current tech stuffed world.
        To only truly be seen through surveillance "proof", is one terrible hurdle in itself, but then to not have any control over their online narrative, and the way data is presented, shared and stored, is another issue in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it better to present all personal data yourself, as many artists/activist have done? When the surveillance is turned on itself, the idea is that the publisher can control it, but what does that mean moving forward? Does every photo, email, message, location need to be public at all times to have control over one's online self? That eliminates the neccessary anonimity required for safety in our online world.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does this over sharing then erasing of truth mean moving forward with more advanced technology? We've already seen information about facial recognition and artificial intelligence systems not being able to differentiate faces of color. As the use of these technologies invade the justice system, how can we protect people from false identification, or baised algorithms?
