      <h1> d&eacute;rive</h1>
      <p>This d&eacute;rive began while looking at a page on Geographic Information Systems, a class I'm enrolled in this quarter. I began on the World Health Organization's page, and after reading the definition, I followed a link to an article about how geo technologies are used to make data driven decisions. This article was specifically about areas in the world that are very dirty through lack of sewage systems and pollution. From there I looked up what the dirtiest place in the world is, apparently Baku, Azerbaijan. When I looked at photos of Baku, however, it looked quite lovely. I looked at Lonely Planet's guide to Baku, in case I want to visit in the future. I then remembered a girl in high school, Zema, who was from Baku. I spent some time looking at her Facebook page and see that she's now living in Amsterdam, studying Jazz.   </p>
